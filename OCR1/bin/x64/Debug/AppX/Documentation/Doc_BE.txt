BACKEND DOCUMENTATION
V. 0.1

Project goals include:
	- Optical Character Recognition implementation
	- Research in field of OCR
	- Project managment 

Tasks:

There are 2 main tasks for the Backend:
	1. Preparing the Image
	2. Recognizing the Image

Each Task Should:
	1. Have an organized structure for both, the Files, and the
	   Coding itself. This Includes:
			- Naming Variables, Functions, Files and Folders Appropriately.

			- Naming Variables, Functions, Files and Folders in a way, 
			  that the other Backend Devs can also understand what 
			  purpose they have.

			- Having Comments with a brief explanation of the Function or
			  an important Variable.

			- Coding in a way, that the other Backend Devs can understand
			  what is going on in the individual part of the Program.

	2. Have Code only within the File for the specific Part of the Program.

Preparing the Image:
	This Task is intended for 2+ People, and Includes:
		1. Transforming the Image into (ideally) an Array.
			(Please Note that the Array should not have Colors)
			(\Backend\ImagePrep\Digitalize.cs)

		2. Removing Artifacts from the Image.
			(\Backend\ImagePrep\Cleanup.cs)

		3. Transforming the Image, so that the Letter(s) are in the Middle
		   of a Rectangle / Square.
			(\Backend\ImagePrep\Transform.cs)

	Devs Allocated to this Task should work in the \Backend\ImagePrep\
	Directory.


Recognizing the Image:
	This Task is a 1 Person only Job, and Includes:
		1. Programming the Structure for the ANN.

		2. Optimizing the Structure for the ANN.

		3. Training the ANN.

		4. Improving the Training for the ANN.

		5. Repeating Steps 2-5 until an Efficient ANN with fast Training
		   is achieved.
